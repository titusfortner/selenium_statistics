# SeleniumStatistics

This gem will collect counts and times for each wire call your code makes.

## Usage

When gem is required, statistics will be collected for each wire call.
To access current results, call ```SeleniumStatistics.print_results```

Results can be ported to a file using ```SeleniumStatistics.logger.output = file_name```

Additional debugging information can be obtained by setting 
```SeleniumStatistics.logger.level = :info``` or ```SeleniumStatistics.logger.level = :debug```
